These are short installation instructions. They contain what needs to be done
in order to install and play around with the Perl101.org codebase.

- Install a webserver (apache, lighttpd, etc.).
- Create the "build" folder for the "crank" script.
- Make sure that the "href" path defined in "section.tt"'s javascript matches
  where your CGI folder will be. It assumes it well be in "/cgi-bin".
- Make sure that the path for the captcha pictures hardcoded in
  "tt/show_captcha.tt" is good for you.
- If you need to adjust the path in "show_captcha.tt", recompile the templates
  using the following command:
  $ jemplate --compile tt/show_captcha.tt tt/show_result.tt > static/js/jmpls.js
  (you must have Jemplate installed)
- Run the crank script.
- Copy the built HTML files in your "build" folder into the document root of
  your Perl101.
- Copy the "static" folder to the same document root.
- Copy over the formmail.pl and auth.pl into the appropriate CGI folder
  (usually this would be "cgi-bin")
- Make sure the paths for $data_folder in both files reflects where you want
  to keep the captchas. I would recommend writing a full path.
- Change the $recipient to your email address in "formmail.pl".
  (you can comment off the entire Email::Stuff part to avoid emails entirely)
